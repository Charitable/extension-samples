# Charitable Extension Samples

This is a repository of sample extension code created to help developers extend Charitable. 

## Who is this for? 

The code samples included are aimed at developers. We expect you to be able to read and *understand* the code.  

If you are not comfortable with PHP, this is *not* for you. Instead, we recommend the [library](https://github.com/Charitable/library) for a collection of code snippets that you can copy and paste.
